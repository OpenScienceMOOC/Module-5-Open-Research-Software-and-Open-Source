**Learning Objectives**:

*LO5a: Learn the characteristics of open software; understand the **ethical, legal, economic, and research impact arguments for and against open software**, and further understand the quality requirements of open code (knowledge).*

*LO5b: Be able to turn code made for personal use into open code which is accessible by others (task).*

*LO5c: Use software (tools) that utilizes open content (task).*

### Key components

-   Principles of Open Source Software.
-   What open, collaborative platforms, with version control, exist.
-   GitHub and Zenodo plug-in for code archiving.
-   How to document and publish code.
-   Open Source licensing.
-   Tools for better open research (e.g., RStudio).
-   Community codes, governance, and contributions.
-   How to access and start working on general computing platforms (e.g., GCE, AWS, OpenStack and more specific - Galaxy, InsideDNA).
-   Differences in setting up accounts/storage/computing on different platforms.
-   Comparison in terms of collaboration and openness with clusters/in-house servers.

### Who to involve

-   Individuals: Paola Masuzzo, Naomi Penfold, Titus Brown, Rene Bernard, Daniel Katz, Neil Chue Hong, Heidi Seibold, Anna Kostikova.
-   Organisations: Sustainable Software Institute, COKO Foundation, [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/).
