## Module 5: Initiate and plan

### Define the target groups
   
   - Computational researchers
   - Graduate and undergraduate students
   - Data scientists
   - Any other researcher who uses analytical code/software
   
### Refine the learning objectives and outcomes
   
   - The learner will be able to define the characteristics of open source research software, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.
   - Based on community standards, learners will be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.
   - The learner will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open source software.
   - Individual learners will be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.
