<h2>Collaborating and contributing through Open Source <a name="Collaborating"></a></h2>
<p>Often, OSS is developed in a public, decentralised, collaborative manner between multiple contributors. The purpose of this is to enhance the diversity and scope of a project and its design, in order to become more beneficial and sustainable. Such an approach was famously likened to a ‘bazaar’ model by Eric Raymond, an early OSS proponent. One of the major guiding principles of this is that of <strong>peer production</strong>, which relies on self-organised communities to regulate the development of content, co-ordinated towards a shared goal or outcome.</p>
<p>OSS projects rely heavily on volunteer collaboration, which often entails a constant flux of newcomers in order to become productive and sustainable (<a href="https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Source%20and%20Open%20Research%20Software/Steinmacher%20et%20al.%2C%202014.pdf">Steinmacher et al., 2014</a>). Creating the right social atmosphere for a project, and a welcoming engagement environment, are often critical to successful collaboraitons in OSS.</p>

<p>Hopefully now you have come to see the importance of software as a cornerstone of modern science, and the importance that OSS plays in this.</p>
<p>The <strong>learning outcomes</strong> from this should be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You will now be able to define the characteristics of OSS, and some of the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on community standards, you will now be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.</p></li>
<li><p>You will now be able to use a range of research tools that utilise OSS.</p></li>
<li><p>You will now be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.</p></li>
<li><p>Software developers will be able to make their software citable, and software users will know how to cite the software they use.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BONUS TASK</strong></p>
<p>Task 3 <a href="https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source/blob/master/content_development/Task_3.md">(also available on github)</a> will take you a step deeper into integrating Git into a typical research workflow by showing you how to integrate it with RStudio. It is recommended that you have completed the first 2 tasks before proceeding with this one.</p>
