## Appendix

However, your Open Source journey does not stop here! This was just the beginning, and there are some incredible resources out there if you would like to do or learn more:

* If you feel particularly inspired by this, you can endorse the [Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/), which is based on the five principles of code, copyright, citation, credit, and curation.

* To launch and develop your own project, the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) program offers a range of practical guides and skills to help launch and advance your OSS projects.

* For a detailed look at OSS-based research workflows, the [Open Science, Open Data, Open Source](https://pfern.github.io/OSODOS/gitbook/) hand-guide by Pedro L. Fernandes and Rutger A. Vos is one of the top resources online.

* More formalised journal venues also exist for software-based articles, including [The Journal of Open Research Software](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/) and [The Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).  A list of such venues is also [available](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software).

* The [PLOS Open Source Toolkit](https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit) provides a global forum for Open Source hardware and software research and applications.

* The [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org) is a nonprofit organization that supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software. Some of the projects they sponsor include:

  * [IPython](http://ipython.org) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) initiatives.

  * [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org), which promotes the open source R statistical environment for transparent and reproducible research.

  * To gain more hands on experience with OSS, the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) community holds regular workshops to improve lab-based computing skills ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Source%20and%20Open%20Research%20Software/Wilson%20et%20al.%2C%202017.pdf)).
