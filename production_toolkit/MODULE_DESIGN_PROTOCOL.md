# MOOC module design protocol

This protocol will guide you through the the activities for developing modules for the Open Science MOOC.

This is a collaborative, team-based effort. Each module has its own repo on GitHub:

1. [Open Principles](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles)
2. [Open Collaboration](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-2-Collaborative-Platforms)
3. [Reproducible Research and Data Analysis](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-3-Reproducible-Research-and-Data-Analysis)
4. [Open Research Data](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-4-Open-Research-Data)
5. [Open Research Software and Open Source](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source)
6. [Open Access to Research Papers](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Resea)
7. [Open Evaluation](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-7-Open-Evaluation)
8. [Public Engagement with Science](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-8-Public-Engagement-with-Science)
9. [Open Educational Resources](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-9-Open-Educational-Resources)
10. [Open Advocacy](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-10-Open-Advocacy)

Each module also has its own specific set of key resources to aid with content development:

1. [Open Principles](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#one)
2. [Open Collaboration](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#two)
3. [Reproducible Research and Data Analysis](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#three)
4. [Open Research Data](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#four)
5. [Open Research Software and Open Source](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#five)
6. [Open Access to Research Papers](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#six)
7. [Open Evaluation](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#seven)
8. [Public Engagement with Science](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#eight)
9. [Open Educational Resources](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#nine)
10. [Open Advocacy](https://opensciencemooc.eu/open-science-resources/#ten)

## Forming a team for collaborative design

1. Hopefully, you&#39;ve identified which module program to work on. It is probably best that you are already familiar with this topic. Building your core team is the next step. You will need a combination of:
   1. Experts. These will be your bread and butter. This can comprise people from any background, including academics, librarians, journalists, policymakers, librarians and information specialists, advocates, and students.
   2. It might also be useful to supplement this with learning designers, including those familiar with learning technologies.
   3. Being a trainer, educator, or educational expert is not a prerequisite. However, it would not hurt to have someone familiar with this on your team.
2. Having an initial briefing meeting will be the second step. This will be in conjunction with either a member of the MOOC Steering Committee, or if you&#39;re really unlucky, Jon. In this meeting, the following will be covered:
   1. An introduction to the MOOC, the managerial team, the core team, and an understanding of the requirements of each.
   2. Expectations of what each will contribute and receive from taking part.
   3. An explanation of time scales and commitments.
   4. An exploration of the MOOC module, the design and development protocol, the knowledge that will be included, and what the challenges to be addressed are.
   5. The core learning outcomes and mission objectives for the module. These are all defined in the [Proposed Modules](https://opensciencemooc.eu/proposed-modules/) section of the companion website for the MOOC.
3. Setting a timeline and action plan for development.
4. Acquiring team information. Each team member will be required to provide:
   1. A profile picture.
   2. A short bio.
   3. Twitter handle (where appropriate).
   4. Personal website (where appropriate).
5. Publicising the team to the MOOC companion website, [here](https://opensciencemooc.eu/about-us/production-team/).

## The development process

   3. Find resources (video, illustrations, screencasts, podcasts, assignments, quizzes, presentations)
   4. Write concise, engaging video (and audio) scripts
   5. Review all learning resources, adjusting as needed
   6. Finalise all scripts
   7. Copyright strategy
3. Recording and editing
   1. Record either on location, online, or within studio
   2. Preference to non-&#39;floating head&#39; styles
   3. Edit all audio/visual material

9. Promotion
   1. Content and communication calendar/strategy/timeline
   2. Identify relevant channels, including:
       1. Mailing lists

    5. Monitor learner experiences and reactions
    6. Prepare to provide additional information if required
11. Reviewing and optimisation
    1. Collate and review learner feedback at regular intervals
    2. Track any potential new information during course duration
